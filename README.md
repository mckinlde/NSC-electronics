1. Resistance (R)

    What it is: Resistance is the opposition to direct current (DC) flow in a circuit.

    What causes it: It comes from physical things like wire material, length, and thickness.

    Unit: Ohms (Ω)

    Example: A simple resistor in a DC circuit. If you connect a resistor to a battery, it slows down the flow of electrons (current), turning some of the energy into heat.

Think of it like friction in a water pipe: it slows the flow down.

2. Reactance (X)

    What it is: Reactance is the opposition to alternating current (AC) caused by capacitors and inductors.

    Two types:

        Capacitive Reactance (Xc): Happens in capacitors; it decreases with higher frequencies.

        Inductive Reactance (Xl): Happens in inductors; it increases with higher frequencies.

    Unit: Ohms (Ω), just like resistance.

    Key idea: Reactance doesn’t "resist" current in the same way as resistance—it temporarily stores energy and then gives it back.

Imagine water sloshing back and forth in a tank: it doesn’t just flow one way, it reacts and pushes back depending on how fast you try to move it.

3. Impedance (Z) ((Recall; R = **resist**ance, X = **react**ance))

    What it is: Impedance is the total opposition to AC. It combines both resistance and reactance.

    Formula:
    Z=R2+X2
    Z=R2+X2

    ​

    (for simple circuits—more complex ones involve phase angles and complex numbers).

    Unit: Ohms (Ω)

    Why it matters: In real AC circuits, we always deal with impedance—not just resistance—because both R and X affect current flow.

You can think of impedance as a combination of friction (resistance) and springiness (reactance). It tells you the total "difficulty" for AC to move through a circuit.

1. Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)

    "The total current entering a point (node) in a circuit is equal to the total current leaving that point."

    Think of it like a traffic intersection: however many cars go in, the same number must come out.

    Why? Because charge can't build up at a node—it has to go somewhere.

✅ Key idea: Current is conserved at a junction.
2. Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)

    "The total voltage around any closed loop in a circuit is zero."

    Imagine walking around a loop in a circuit: if you add up all the voltage gains (like batteries) and subtract all the drops (like resistors), you’ll always end up back at zero.

    It’s like climbing up and down hills—you come back to the same elevation when you complete the loop.

✅ Key idea: Energy is conserved in a loop.

🎓 Teaching Demonstration: Voltage Drops and Current Flow in the Circuit

(You’ll be drawing the circuit on the whiteboard as you explain. Here's how to guide the class through it.)
🧠 Step 1: Overview of the Circuit

    "This is a simple DC circuit powered by a 12V battery and includes three resistors: R1 = 100Ω, R2 = 200Ω, and R3 = 300Ω."

Now draw the circuit showing:

    The battery (12V)

    R1, R2, and R3 connected in series (all in a straight line)

    Current flowing clockwise from the positive terminal

🔁 Step 2: Current Flow (Use Ohm’s Law)

    “Since all resistors are connected in series, the same current flows through each of them.”

First, calculate the total resistance:
Rtotal=R1+R2+R3=100Ω+200Ω+300Ω=600Ω
Rtotal​=R1​+R2​+R3​=100Ω+200Ω+300Ω=600Ω

Now use Ohm’s Law to find the current:
I=VR=12V600Ω=0.02A=20mA
I=RV​=600Ω12V​=0.02A=20mA

✅ Conclusion: The current through every resistor is 20 mA.
🔋 Step 3: Voltage Drops Across Each Resistor

    “In a series circuit, voltage is divided across the resistors based on their resistance values.”

Now calculate:

    V1=I×R1=0.02A×100Ω=2VV1​=I×R1​=0.02A×100Ω=2V

    V2=I×R2=0.02A×200Ω=4VV2​=I×R2​=0.02A×200Ω=4V

    V3=I×R3=0.02A×300Ω=6VV3​=I×R3​=0.02A×300Ω=6V

✅ Check: Total voltage drop = 2V+4V+6V=12V2V+4V+6V=12V ✅ Matches battery voltage!
💡 Key Teaching Points

    Same current flows through all components in a series circuit.

    Voltage divides proportionally based on each resistor’s value.

    The sum of voltage drops equals the total supplied voltage (Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law).

🧪 Demo Conclusion

    “So in this circuit, we learned how to analyze current flow and voltage drops step-by-step using Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws. With a total current of 20mA and clearly defined drops across each resistor, this example is perfect for building intuition about how real circuits behave.”

🧲 What Is Impedance?

Impedance (symbol: ZZ) is the total opposition a circuit offers to the flow of alternating current (AC). It’s like resistance, but more complex—because it combines:

    Resistance (R): The "normal" opposition to current (like in DC circuits).

    Reactance (X): The opposition caused by capacitors and inductors that depends on frequency.

It’s measured in ohms (Ω), just like resistance.
🧮 Impedance Is a Complex Number

This is where it gets mathematical:
Z=R+jX
Z=R+jX

    RR: resistance (real part)

    XX: reactance (imaginary part)

    jj: imaginary unit (in electronics we use jj instead of ii because ii is used for current)

This lets us handle both the magnitude of the opposition and the phase shift (delay between voltage and current).
🎛️ Reactance Details

Reactance depends on the component type:
1. Inductive Reactance (XLXL​)
XL=2πfL
XL​=2πfL

    ff = frequency

    LL = inductance in henries (H)

    Increases with frequency

    Current lags voltage

2. Capacitive Reactance (XCXC​)
XC=12πfC
XC​=2πfC1​

    CC = capacitance in farads (F)

    Decreases with frequency

    Current leads voltage

🔍 Magnitude of Impedance

To find how much the impedance actually resists current, we calculate its magnitude:
∣Z∣=R2+X2
∣Z∣=R2+X2
​

This tells us the “effective” resistance AC feels, combining both resistance and reactance.
⏱️ Phase Angle (θ)

Impedance also introduces a phase angle, which tells us how much the current and voltage are out of sync:
θ=tan⁡−1(XR)
θ=tan−1(RX​)

    If X>0X>0: Inductive (current lags)

    If X<0X<0: Capacitive (current leads)

    If X=0X=0: Purely resistive (in phase)

🧑‍🏫 Why Impedance Matters in Real Circuits

    AC power systems: Impedance affects power delivery and efficiency.

    Audio electronics: Matching impedance ensures good sound transfer.

    RF circuits: Antennas and transmission lines rely on impedance matching.

    Filters: Capacitors and inductors create frequency-dependent impedance to block or pass certain signals.

🎯 Real-World Example:

Suppose you have:

    A resistor R=100ΩR=100Ω

    An inductor L=0.1HL=0.1H

    At frequency f=60Hzf=60Hz

Then:

    XL=2π×60×0.1=37.7ΩXL​=2π×60×0.1=37.7Ω

    Z=100+j37.7Z=100+j37.7

    ∣Z∣=1002+37.72≈107Ω∣Z∣=1002+37.72

    ​≈107Ω

    Phase angle θ=tan⁡−1(37.7/100)≈20.7∘θ=tan−1(37.7/100)≈20.7∘

So:

    The circuit behaves like a 107Ω resistor

    But the current lags voltage by ~21°
